                  <p class="card-text">Our roommates, Joel and Rebecca, were dating and Joel brought Fletcher and a few others over for a games night (even though we didn't actually get to the games). We hit it off in Glori's kitchen. Fletcher was teasing Glori while cutting the banana bread she had made. They got to tease each other more as Glori helped Fletcher cut the banana bread. It was game on from there</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Fletcher asked Glori out and it was a double with Rebecca and Joel. The date was so good it was like 5 hours long. We started by making pizza dough together and played a game while waiting for it to rise. We then made the pizza and played another game waiting for it to cook. We then talked with Rebecca, Joel, and Jon for like an hour. Lastly we watched episode 3 season 3 of the Mandalorian. This was right after a 2 week long road trip that Glori and Fletcher had taken covering Utah, Arizona, and Washington. It was really fun. For our one year we were able to relax together and realize how much we had grown</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Fletcher had an internship down in Price, UT the summer of 2023 and he had invited Glori down to visit the ward and meet his friends down there. It was here outside of his bishop's house after a veeeerrry eventful day of several failed plans where Fletcher asked Glori to be his girlfriend and well she said yes.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Fletcher had helped Glori drive back home for the summer and this was right before they went long distance for the summer. Long distance was difficult so it was really nice to have these moments in Tucson. This was a really siginificant move because this was the first time that Fletcher had been to Glori's home. This was also the first time Fletcher met Glori's parents. Except he didn't ask her parents for her hand here he waited until his trip in August! </p>

                    <p class="card-text">We had been dating for a whole year at this point and had gotten to meet a lot of each others families. It was right before our one year mark that we took a two week long road trip visiting family in Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. It was so fun and we got to experience new things like visiting a missile silo in Tucson and going on the river together in Washington! This was before celebrating our one year which we did relaxing in Provo. Glori got Fletcher two Star Wars lego sets and Fletcher got Glori a beautiful necklace and earrings (no rings yet!)</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Fletcher pulled off the sweetest surprise for Glori with this engagement. The day before Fletcher proposed, he had made the down payment for the ring they were designing for Glori. So she was not suspecting anything. He had planned our a treasure hunt around Provo to places that were important in our relationship. He started with assitance from Glori's roommate Naomie who created an entire assignment to get Glori's outfit and nails done. She then gave Glori the first step in the hunt. Glori met one of their friends at each locations:First meeting, First major Step, First Kiss, First "I Love You", Dinner making spot (N205) Fletcher's old apartment from last year, and the first spot we went rapelling together. These all led to Big Springs Park up the canyon. It was here that Glori met Fletcher who walked her over to the same spot that they had been a year ago and a week before. He had put up a photo wall. He got down on one knee, popped the question and pulled out a ring he had HANDMADE from aluminum. It was beautiful and Glori said YES!!</p>
